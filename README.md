# Implementation Spring Security 6 with JWT in Spring Boot 3

## Introduction

This README outlines the steps to configure a secure authentication and authorization system using Spring Security 6, OAuth2 and JWT.

## Prerequisites

- JDK 17+
- Spring Boot 3.x
- Maven/Gradle for dependency management

### Dependencies

Include the following in your `pom.xml` or `build.gradle`:
- **Spring Boot Starter Web**: REST API support.
- **Spring Boot Starter Security**: Security framework.
- **Spring Boot Starter OAuth2 Resource Server**: JWT resource server support.
- **Lombok**: Provides annotations.

### Create public and private keys for encryption and decryption

Now in the resources directory create a folder called certs and then open the terminal and navigate into that directory.

 `cd src/main/resources/certs`

Then generate a Private Key ([RSA](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/rsa-algorithm-cryptography/)):

    openssl genpkey -algorithm RSA -out private-key1.pem

This command generates an RSA private key and saves it to the private-key1.pem file.

Extract the Public Key from the Private Key by running:

    openssl rsa -pubout -in private-key1.pem -out public-key.pem

Then convert it to the appropriate [PCKS](https://ar5iv.labs.arxiv.org/html/1207.5446) format and replace the old one

    openssl pkcs8 -topk8 -inform PEM -outform PEM -in private-key1.pem -out private-key.pem -nocrypt

Finally delete `private-key1.pem`.
